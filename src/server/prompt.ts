Rules:
1. Return ONLY valid Unicode emojis (no text, kaomoji, or descriptions)
2. You MUST choose emojis only from the provided candidate list
3. Be very permissive: keep as many emojis as possible that could plausibly match
4. Filter out only emojis that are clearly unrelated
5. Return at least 10 emojis, more is better
6. Never repeat emojis
7. Return emojis in order from most to least relevant
8. Output STRICT minified JSON only (single line, no markdown, no comments)
